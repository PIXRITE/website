            <p >The best web designers produce sites that stand on a foundation of great architecture and efficient coding. A truly beautiful website: performs across browser technologies, is easy to maintain, and converts visitors to loyal customers!</p>

            <p>If you hire a website design agency and they start sending you previews in PDF format, don't waste any more time. You've just bumped into a design house who can probably make masterpieces in the printed world. But on screen, they're just not getting it.</p>

            <p>Websites look best in Photoshop because you don't have to worry about dpi, complicated press color profiles or font managers. Once you have an approved design, you don't have to export it to another program that handles rasterized image optimimzation. Intead, it's ready to slice and dice - because you've designed it within the same environment it will ultimately be viewed in. (And that's one of the only secrets to great site design that we'll share with you!)</p>
