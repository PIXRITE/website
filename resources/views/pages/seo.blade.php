            <p>Local Search Optimization is currently one of our more popular services. It's less expensive and more effective than traditional search engine optimization simply because the competition decreases. It's also the best replacement for your old school phone directory ad. Even phonebook companies are replacing their traditional services with new and improved online listings and directory services. Search engines continue to refine their accuracy, making the need to claim your placement in local searches critical to your continued success. We can help.</p>

            <h2>Organic Search Results: A very important part of online diet!</h2>

            <p>Organic is the new green! There are a lot (and we mean A LOT) of companies out there who could spend half as much money on organic search engine optimization and reap greater rewards than they're getting from their sponsored efforts. These are the results that have always and will forever get the most clicks. Nothing turns people off like a commercial--and the organic side of search results provide genuine content.</p>

            <p>SEO companies are a dime a dozen--but ethics are as rare in this industry as they are in gambling. We are the folks who build "real" into your site. We add value and we're legit. If you're looking for a negotiator to buy links at the lowest price, please move on. We believe in the theory of increasing your traffic by increasing your offer. We'll optimize your site for poeple--and the search engines will come.</p>

            <h2>PPC campaigns that convert.</h2>

            <p>What possible good will your dollars do on Google AdwordsÂ® if you don't have landing pages that convert? PIXRITE is a one-stop-shop for your online advertising needs. We have national connections to help us segment your campaigns into the right markets. We know how to capture that "info past the click".</p>

            <p>Many companies underestimate the resources required to run successful PPC advertising. We'll help you form your strategy, find your optimal words, pick your target audiences, design your landing pages, collect your analytics and increase the value of your PPC dollars!</p>
